# Snake cube solver

This is a short jupyter notebook in Python 3 that solves 3x3x3 snake cubes.

I wrote it because I was too impatient and lazy to solve a snake cube I had lying around, and yet wanted to store the thing in the most space efficient way - so it had to become a proper cube.

The program takes a simple encoding of a snake:

<img src="./pics/green_snake.jpg" alt="drawing" title="Green Snake" width="200"/> <img src="./pics/blue_snake.jpg" alt="drawing" title="Blue Snake" width="200"/>

And generates instructions how to turn it into a cube:

<img src="./pics/green_cube.jpg" alt="drawing" title="Green Snake" width="200"/>
<img src="./pics/blue_cube.jpg" alt="drawing" title="Blue Snake" width="200"/>

## Requirement~s~:
- numpy, any version will do
